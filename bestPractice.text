Best Practices for used during Testing:

    Page Object Model (POM):
        Use the Page Object Model (POM) pattern to maintain clean and maintainable test code.
        Separate the test logic from the implementation details of the application under test by encapsulating web elements and actions within page objects.

    Fixture Usage:
        Utilize fixtures to externalize test data from test scripts.
        Store various test data and parameters in fixture files to enhance reusability and maintainability.

    Test Case Structure:
        Organize test cases according to their functionality or use cases.
        Each test case should focus on testing a specific feature or scenario.
        Write clear and descriptive test names to indicate the purpose of the test case.

    Reporting:
        Generate comprehensive test reports to track test execution results and identify issues.
        Use multiple reporters, such as JUnit XML, JSON, and HTML, to capture different aspects of test execution.
        Incorporate charts and graphs in HTML reports to visualize test metrics and provide stakeholders with meaningful insights.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures during test execution.
        Use Cypress hooks (beforeEach, afterEach, etc.) to execute setup and teardown logic and handle test failures.

    Plugin Usage:
        Leverage Cypress plugins to extend and enhance testing capabilities.
        Choose plugins that align with project requirements and provide additional features like reporting, mocking, and code coverage.

    Dependency Management:
        Manage dependencies effectively using npm or yarn to ensure consistency and compatibility across environments.
        Specify exact versions of packages or use version ranges cautiously to prevent unexpected issues due to breaking changes.

    Documentation using comment:
        Document test scripts, configurations, and setup instructions to facilitate collaboration and onboarding of new team members.
        Include comments within test code to explain complex logic or to provide context for future maintenance.
